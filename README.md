# Four_in_a_row

A game between two players where each tries to get 4 of the coins in a row in one of 4 directions and prevent other player to do so. A player that achieves 4 coins in a row is victorious and the game is over. It is possible to change the colors of the coins.


The goal of the project was to get fammiliar with Windows forms and creating a program with interactable graphical user interface. To solve the game problem, it had to be broken down into several functions in order to get a proper solution without hardcoding or duplicating code on several places. Other requirements were also to learn how to draw on canvas using different graphical functions and basics of event based programming to react to mouse clicks of the user on different GUI elements.


USAGE:

The application was made on and for Windows 10 platform using Visual Studio 2019. The project contains the executable for running the application (EXE folder), Visual Studio 2019 solution and the source code. 

When testing on another Windows machine apart from the one on which it was developed, it was found that running the .exe files sometimes doesn't work on the first try so the user needs to try again until the game can be played. The source code is also present so the user can also manually rebuild the program.
